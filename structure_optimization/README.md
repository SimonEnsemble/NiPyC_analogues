The files and directories within are used in the process of DFT-based geometry optimization with the [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) v6.5 (QE) free and open-source software package.

## pre-calculation 
- `QE_input_generator.ipynb`:  a `jupyter-notebook` which generates input scripts for QE.
- `QE_input_scripts`: contains the input scripts used for DFT calculations.
- `pseudo`: directory contains the pseudopotential files used in the DFT calculations.

## submission files
- `AA_mofs_to_relax.txt`: the file containing the input filename of the structures you wish to run DFT calculations on.
- `submit_qe_jobs.sh`: the executable shell script which submits batch jobs Slurm. Note that the computational output is large.
- `qe_sims_submit.sh`: the shell script, called by `submit_qe_jobs.sh`, to run QuantumESPRESSO DFT calculations on the HPC cluster.

## post-calculation
- `QE_relaxation_results`: location of `*.out` and `*.err` files generated by QE. Subdirectories named by functional and calculation type.
- `QE_output_to_cif.ipynb`: a `jupyter-notebook` which generates a `.cif` file from QE results.
- `post-relaxation_cifs`: contains the `.cif` files generated from QE results.
