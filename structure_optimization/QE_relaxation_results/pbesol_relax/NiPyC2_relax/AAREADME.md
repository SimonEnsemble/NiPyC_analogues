These are the output files for DFT calculations run a single unit cell of Ni(PyC)2 and its derivatives. 
They are deliberately separated from the other outputs which used the same `pbesol` exchange correlation and `relax` calculation type since they are a single unit cell as oppised to a 2x1x1 supercell.
