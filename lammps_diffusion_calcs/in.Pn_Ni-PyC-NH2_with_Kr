#  mean-squared disp of grp 1 
#
# A vector of four quantities is calculated by this compute: 
# The first 3 elements of the vector are the squared dx,dy,dz displacements, summed and averaged over atoms in the group. 
# The fourth element is the total squared displacement, i.e. (dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz), 
#  summed and averaged over atoms in the group.
#
# The slope of the MSD versus time is proportional to the diffusion coefficient.
# MSD values can be accumulated in a vector via the fix vector command, 
#   and a line fit to the vector to compute its slope via the variable slope function, 
#   and thus extract D.

# The slope() function uses linear regression to fit a line to the set of points, 
#   equally spaced by 1 in their x coordinate: (1,V1), (2,V2), â€¦, (N,VN), 
#   where the Vi are the values in the global vector of length N. 
#   The returned value is the slope of the line. 
#   If the line has a single point or is vertical, it returns 1.0e20.
