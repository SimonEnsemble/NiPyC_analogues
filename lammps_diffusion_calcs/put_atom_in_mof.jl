###
#  Strategy:
#
# 1. standard setup for GCMC sim using xtal, mol, UFF, temp etc.
# 2. run a short GCMC simulation to put molecules (Xe or Kr) into extal 
#    be sure to store results and molecule outputs
# 3. randomly select a sindle molecule that is inside the replicated xtal
#    (this one will serve as the MD diffusion probe)
# 4. assert that it is inside of the simulation box
# 5. write a new xtal which includes the probe molecule inside the fully replicated xtal
# 6. This new system (replicated xtal with adsorbate) will then be passed to lammps-interface
#    so that a data.filename and in.filename will be generated
# 7. The lammps-interface generated input script will then be taken and used as a template for 
#    a script that will be writen to run the diffusion calculations
#       - informatin that we need from this is the grouping indecies
