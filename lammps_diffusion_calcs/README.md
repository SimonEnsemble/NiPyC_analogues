Sorry this repo is a bit of a mess at the moment...

The `.cif` file is generated by the `put_xe_in_mof.jl` scrips which does exactly what it says. 
it loads an xtal and runs a very short GCMC simulation. We take the positions of the the 
adsorbates inside the poes and only keep the ones that are in the original xtal unit cell. 
Then we just create a `.cif` with the adsorbate inside the MOF xtal. 

We then use `lammps-interface` to generate a `LAMMPS` input file so that we can run a MD simulation.
We have to manualy edit the input script so that the framework atoms do not move during the simulation
AND we want to compute the mean-squared displacement. the slope of which gives us the self-diffusion.

All of the other sub-directories are reference and tutorial files that will be removed from the repo 
once I have a working pipeline for these calculations.




NOTE: 
The units in the LAMMPS calculation are set to `real` so the units of distance is angstrom and the unit for time is femtoseconds. 
This means that the msd is given in angstromes squared.
Thus, the diffusion coefficient will be output as angstromes squared per femtosecond. These values are commonly reported as centimeters squared per second. 

For Comparison, see the diffusion of Ar, Kr, and Xe in MOFs tabulated in the SI of [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp302808j)
