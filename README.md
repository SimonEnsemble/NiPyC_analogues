## NOTATION: 
* `MOF_experimental.cif` coresponds to the `.cif` file produced by experimentalists. 
* `MOF_relax.cif` corresponds to the `.cif` file generated by performing DFT relaxation using fixed-volume such that the cell parameters are the same as the experimental values.
* `MOF_vc-relax.cif` corresponds to the `.cif` file generated by performing DFT relaxation and allowing the cell parameters to varry (i.e. vc = variable cell).

The directories NiPyC2_experimental, NiPyC2_relax, and NiPyC2_vc-relax are populated with 2x1x1 replicated and functionalized versions of their respective `.cif` files. The replication is done so that we can get a larger sampling to the randomized position of the functional group while not being so large that the DFT calculations take too long to converge.
