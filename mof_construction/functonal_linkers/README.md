These .xyz files were constructed in Avogadro using the Optimize Geometry function with the following settings-
forcefield: UFF
number of steps: 10000
Algorithm: Steepest Descent
Convergence: 10e-7

The filename convention is "Linker_FunctionalGroup_CarbonPosition_fragment.xyz" were Linker is the name or abreviation of the linker, FunctionalGroup is the element or molecule attached to a carbon, and CarbonPositon references the type of carbon that the molecule is attached to (i.e. ortho meta para). If fragment is present :wq

For example: "PyC_NH2_ortho_fragment.xyz" is a fragment of a Pyc aromatic ring with an NH2 group functionalized to the ortho Carbon w.r.t. the Nitrogen.
