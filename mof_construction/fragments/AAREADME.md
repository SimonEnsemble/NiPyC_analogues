This directory contains the `.xyz` fragment files used during the functionalization process. 
These fragments have labeled anchor atoms which assist in the alignment protocol. 

- `C_aro_R`: the atom on the aromatic ring fragment to which the functional group is bonded
- `C_aro`: the neighboring atoms of `C_aro_R` which define the plane of the ring fragment.
