directories for the functionalized mofs are names as follows:
"MOF_replication_QE-calculation"
crystal structures that have not been replicated will not have a "replication" section in the file name.

The MOF whose parameters are experimentally will say "experiment" in the QE section. "relax" revers to fixed volume structural relaxation and "vc-relax" is variable cell relaxation.

Example: "NiPyC2_sc211_relax" contains `.cif`,`.xyz`, and `.vtk` files for functionalized NiPyC2 which has been replicated with repfactors (2,1,1), and will be used for fixed volume structural optimization.
